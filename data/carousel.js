   IMAGES ARE AUTO-DISCOVERED from: assets/images/carousel/
   Naming: slide-01.jpg, slide-02.png, slide-03.gif, slide-04.mp4
   Formats: jpg, png, gif, mp4, webm  |  Max: 10 slides
   
   Caption data below is matched by ID (slide-01 -> id:"slide-01").
   If a slide image exists but has no caption entry here, it shows
   with no caption — which is fine.
